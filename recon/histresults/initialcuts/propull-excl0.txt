Proton pull of 0 is excluded from this graph, 0 may be a default value of pull if it is unknown.

Proton	-	RED	
pi+		-	Blue
pi-		-	Magenta
e+		-	Cyan
e-		-	Green
mu-		-	Black
mu+		-	Yellow
Other	-	Pink


We can see about (<)50% of particle around (just above) zero proton pull are actually protons.

The black is mu-, a lot of the data is muons. Needs to be removed, look at mu pull?
