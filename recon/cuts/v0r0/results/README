effpur1.png:
	Cuts are:
		0	-	(after initial cuts) Start in FGD && one in time bunch
		1	-	no TPC1 && no POD activity (grouped as one because makes little change)
		2	-	Positive Charge
		3	-	Consecutive Detectors (if FGD1 then require TPC2 || if FGD2 then require TPC3)
		4	-	Muon Pull (removed mupull between -10 and 5)
		5	-	NHits must be below the threshold of 105	

effpur2.png:
	Cuts are:
		0	-	(after initial cuts) Start in FGD && one in time bunch
		1	-	no TPC1 && no POD activity (grouped as one because makes little change)
		2	-	Positive Charge
		3	-	Consecutive Detectors (if FGD1 then require TPC2 || if FGD2 then require TPC3)
		4	-	Muon Pull (removed mupull between -10 and 5)
		5	-	Proton Pull (removed -0.5 to 0.5 WRONG REMOVE)
		6	-	NHits must be below the threshold of 105	

effpur3.png:
	Green line is 4*eff*pur (4 just to make it easier to see the maximum)
	Cuts are:
		0	-	(after initial cuts) Start in FGD && one in time bunch
		1	-	no TPC1 && no POD activity (grouped as one because makes little change)
		2	-	Positive Charge
		3	-	Consecutive Detectors (if FGD1 then require TPC2 || if FGD2 then require TPC3)
		4	-	Muon Pull (removed mupull between -10 and 5)
		5	-	Proton Pull (removed -3 to 15 )
		6	-	NHits must be below the threshold of 105
